documentation: |-
    This block takes float complex values and downsamples to interleaved signed8.  This block would for example pair with a hardware source block such as using an 8-bit SDR and restore the source block's float complex out back to 8-bit values.  Note however that these are signed8 (hackrf format), not unsigned8 (rtl format).
